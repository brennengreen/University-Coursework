\section{CMOS}
\subsection[]{Inverter:}

This implementation proved to be a learning experience. While my theoretical design
from the prelab was correct, I lacked some knowledge regarding the proper orientation
of the MOSFETs. Once I cleared up the issue, and properly oriented the
source and drains of the MOSFETs it worked like a charm.
\subsection[]{NAND:}

This implementation was rather smooth sailing, my implementation followed my design
from the prelab identically and worked first try.
\subsection[]{AND:}

There wasn't much to this implementation at all, just simply routed a new wire
from the output of my NAND to the input of my Inverter and we were good to go.

\section{TTL}
\subsection[]{NAND:}

\subsection[]{AND:}

It's worth grouping these two into one paragraph because they were very straight forward.
I followed my prelab to the T and it worked on the first try. The TTL's are really easy to 
work with.
